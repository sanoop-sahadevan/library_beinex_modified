      A library is a collection of sources of information and similar resources, made accessible to a defined community
      for reference or borrowing. It provides physical or digital access to material, and may be a physical building or
      room, or a virtual space, or both. A library's collection can include books, periodicals, newspapers, manuscripts,
      films, maps, prints, documents, microform, CDs, cassettes, videotapes, DVDs, Blu-ray Discs, e-books, audiobooks,
      databases, and other formats. Libraries range in size from a few shelves of books to several million items.

      The word library derives from the Latin liber, meaning “book,” whereas a Latinized Greek word, bibliotheca, is the
      origin of the word for library in German, Russian, and the Romance languages.
